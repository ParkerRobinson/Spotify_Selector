Product Vision
The latest and greatest music accessory mobile app has just been released and it is blowing other music mobile apps out of the water. SpotifySelector is a new, great
tool for social music listeners of all types. This mobile application allows multiple users to add their Spotify music to a communal playlist, hosted in what is
referred to as a “playlist room”. The playlist room can only be joined using a password that the creator of the room has created, so no need to worry about unwanted
people joining your playlist room. Once a user has joined a room, they can see the list of songs added to the playlist and add their own from the songs on their
Spotify. Users can also vote on the songs in the playlist that they want to hear more. If users downvote a song, the song moves down in the playlist queue. If the
users upvote a song, the song moves up in the queue, and therefore, the song will be played sooner. This simple voting system is genius and something that the social
music world has not yet had, but has needed for a long time. 

This application helps to solve the common disputes over music selection at social events that so many of us have dealt with. This application can be a great tool
for anyone hosting events that does not want to deal with the pressure of selecting songs. Managing an event is stressful as it is, so not having to worry about
changing the song or picking the next song can be a huge relief. This application can even be a great tool in long car rides with a car full of people that want to
listen to different music. Don’t have a pre-made playlist? No problem. Invite your friends to a room, add some songs, vote on a couple, and let SpotifySelector take
care of the rest.
