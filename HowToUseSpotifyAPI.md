In order to use the Spotify API an account has to have accepted their API Terms and Conditions.
Aka a lobby owner, the person whose Spotify account is being used for the lobby, must have already accepted the Terms and Conditions in order to use the API.
They can do so by visiting https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/
They can then accept the Terms & Condtions and Register an App which will give you a Client ID/Secret pair to use in API calls.


For testing purposes we can use when we make RESTful API calls.
ClientID: e04dd3b3613f431499f04b7a6330fbdd
